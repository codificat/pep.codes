I was looking at the [[https://github.com/thoth-station/integration-tests/][integration tests for Thoth GitHub repo]] and I get this warning:

#+begin_quote
The default branch has been renamed!

=master= is now named =main=

If you have a local clone, you can update it by running the following commands.
#+end_quote

These are the commands (git tips):

#+begin_src sh
  git branch -m master main
  git fetch origin
  git branch -u origin/main main
  git remote set-head origin -a
#+end_src

In my case, as this is my =upstream= remote, I did:

#+begin_src sh
  git branch -m master main
  git fetch upstream
  git branch -u upstream/main main
  git remote set-head upstream -a
#+end_src

This is part of Thoth Station's git branch rename effort:
